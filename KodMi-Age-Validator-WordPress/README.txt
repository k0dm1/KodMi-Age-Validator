We have converted the KodMi-Age-Validator to a wordpress plugin with the files you see here.

To install this wordpress plugin just upload the entire folder 
"KodMi-Age-Validator-Wordpress" to the plugin folder under your wordpress installion.

The default path to the wordpress plugin folder is "root wp->wp-content->plugins" 
where "root-wp" is the location where wordpress was installed on your server.
